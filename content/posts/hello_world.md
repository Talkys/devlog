# Test post to check hugo

I'm using the hello-friend-ng theme. Quite easy to use hosting the site on Render. Hugo is way better to use than pelican, but I should note that if you don't prepare your repo after creating the hugo folder, will be a mess to reconfigure everything.

Anyway. This theme will probabli not be my final choice, unless I find a way to make it even more darker.
