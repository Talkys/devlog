So, the thing is: Why the hell does Office programs save files with Ctrl-B? That's the dumbest idea MS could implement.

I'm not open to talk here. SAVING IS CTRL-S PERIOD. It should be a legal requirement that every program allowed to run on computers to use the standard shortcuts: ctrl-s ctrl-c ctrl-v ctrl-b ctrl-x ctrl-a ctrl-i and ctrl-shift-s (maybe we can put ctrl-e too)

Those are universal shorcuts. There's just no way someone can say that saving with ctrl-b makes sense.
